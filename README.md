# predictingDiabetes

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on diabetes detection from [](https://). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict the likelihood of getting diabetes based on your current physical health?
- while model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. K Nearest Neightbour (kNN)

## Conclusion

- Blood pressure and High Cholesterol have the highest tetrachoric correlation value with getting diabetes
- While Gender and Smoking have low tetrachoric correlation value.
- Logistic Regression did better with a better Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores compared to kNN.
- Yes, it is possible to spot risk category of getting diabetes with ~75% accuracy.

## What did we learn from this project?

- Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- K Nearest Neighbor from sklearn
- R programming language for Data Visualization and Processing.
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
