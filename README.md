## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict the likelihood of getting diabetes based on your current physical health?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. K Nearest Neightbour (kNN)

## Conclusion

- It is possible to spot risk category of getting diabetes with ~75% accuracy.
- Both models performed well in predicting the likelihood of Diabetes
- Logistic Regression did better with a better Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores compared to kNN.

## What did we learn from this project?

- Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- K Nearest Neighbor from sklearn
- R programming language for Data Visualization and Processing.
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
